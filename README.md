# YouTube-Income-Calculator
build a dynamic YouTube Income Calculator using chatbot
We created a YouTube Income Calculator to assist content creators in estimating their potential earnings. This tool is a simple, dynamic landing page that allows you to calculate your estimated YouTube income based on your average CPM and number of views.

The calculator is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and has a user-friendly interface with a clean and simple interface. Simply enter your average CPM in USD and the number of views your video received into the calculator, then click the "Calculate Income" button. Based on the information you entered, the calculator will then display your estimated earnings.
